Title: Package for processing and analysis motion capture (mocap) data.
Version: 1.0.0
Author: Tomasz Hachaj, Marek R. Ogiela

Description: With functions from this package you can:
    - load and save Biovision Hierarchy (BVH) files,
    - convert direct kinematic model to hierarchical kinematic model and vice versa,
    - plot interactive plots of motion capture (mocap) data,
    - align two mocap recordings,
    - while walking with translation and acceleration data is is possible to calculate correct body joints displacement,
    - average many motion capture recordings that presents the same activity and store it as a single one,
    - perform comparision analysis of two motion capture recordings using advanced Dynamic Time Wapring - besed procedures and display results,
    This package has also many useful algebraic functions like Quaternion Markley averaging algorithms etc.
