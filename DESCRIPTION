Description: Package RMoCap is an advance open source tool for scientists, engineers and computer graphics familiar with R language who work with motion capture (MoCap) technology. Package supply them with MoCap data handling, statistical processing, visualizing and analysis. Package uses well established MoCap file exchange format and can be easily integrated with most of motion analysis workflows. Among functions available in RMoCap there are procedures for conversion between hierarchical and direct kinematic models, data averaging, correcting direction of motion, 3D interactive visualization and advanced analysis using Dynamic Time Warping.
  With functions from this package you can:
  - load and save Biovision Hierarchy (BVH) files,
  - convert direct kinematic model to hierarchical kinematic model and vice versa,
  - plot interactive plots of motion capture (mocap) data,
  - align two mocap recordings,
  - it is possible to calculate correct body joints displacement,
  - average many motion capture recordings that present the same activity,
  - perform comparison analysis of two motion capture recordings using advanced Dynamic Time Warping - based procedures,
  This package has also many useful algebraic functions like Quaternion Markley averaging algorithms etc.
